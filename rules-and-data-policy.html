<center><h1>Minesveeper Custom Setting Rules and Data Policy</h1></center>
<h3>You may:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Upload any casual / genuine settings (obviously).
    <li>Upload joke settings / near impossible settings.
    <li>Upload settings without an author/title or description written
    <li>Upload corrupted settings for the sake of pointing out issues (Though those may still be subjected to auto deletion)
	<li>Use swearing (within reason)
	<li>Modify other settings (given it is in a relevant manner and not just to upload it under your name)
</ul>
<h3>You may not:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Upload settings that include any form of illegal content.
    <li>Upload spam settings.
	<li>Upload settings that can crash/freeze the game.
    <li>Automatically mass upload settings.
    <li>Bypass sanity checks for reasonable settings. Settings that cannot generate a board after a first click may be subject to auto deletion.
    <li>Try to impersonate someone else
	<li>Encourage the player to run harmful Javascript code in the debug console
</ul>
<h3>You agree to:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Json representation of your setting becoming publicly accessible
    <li>Heptaveegesimal being allowed to distribute your setting
    <li>Not being able to delete the setting yourself as it will not be linked to any account
    <li>Your setting being stored together with a hash resulting from a combination of your IP Address and User Agent (not publicly accessible but may likely be used for moderation purposes)
	<li>Everyone else being allowed to make modified versions of your setting.
</ul>
Note: Uploading settings by bypassing the check for the "I agree" checkbox through source code editing or other means, will still be treated as an agreement to these conditions.<br><br>
<h3>A good setting should (these are not rules, but recommendations):</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Always be able to generate a board, no matter where the player starts
	<li>Not be able to kill the player through chain reactions
	<li>Be reasonably possible to solve
	<li>Have a title, author and description
	<li>Only use non uniform mine probability in problematic areas or when mentioned in the description
	<li>Not rely on the out of bounds texture as a gameplay mechanic. Settings that can in theory produce larger numbers are allowed, but your setting should not depend on a certain number of mines falling out of bounds. 
	<li>Avoid combining Red and Green, when only 2 types of colorcharge are needed
</ul>
